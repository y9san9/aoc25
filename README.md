# Advent of Code 2025

> Leaderboard: `5193696-21723143`

This year I wanted to solve advent of code in random language every day. But
since recently I have this (russian-speaking) [Telegram
Channel](https://t.me/kotlinmeta) about Kotlin, I have to do it in Kotlin 😅.

Anyways, what challenge did I make for myself this year? I started using vim as
my primary dev tool for everything, including Kotlin
([here](https://github.com/y9san9/y9san9.nvim) is my config btw). That's why I
decided to make these restrictions for me:

- ❌ No AI (in any form)
- ❌ No auto-complete (LSPs, Intellij, etc.)
- ❌ No build system (Gradle, Maven, etc.)

So I use Kotlin Scripting and edit Kotlin code in vim with almost no plugins.
That's definitely more fun for me even if it's slower. A list of days:

- Day 1
    - [Part 1](day1.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day1.part2.main.kts)
- Day 2
    - [Part 1](day2.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day2.part2.main.kts)
- Day 3
    - [Part 1](day3.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day3.part2.main.kts)
- Day 4
    - [Part 1](day4.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day4.part2.main.kts)
- Day 5
    - [Part 1](day5.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day5.part2.main.kts)
- Day 6
    - [Part 1](day6.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day6.part2.main.kts)
- Day 7
    - [Part 1](day7.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day7.part2.main.kts)
- Day 8
    - [Part 1](day8.part1.main.kts)
    - [Part 2](day8.part2.main.kts)
- Day 9
    - [Part 1](day9.part1.main.kts)
    - Skill issue

To launch day, use:

```bash
kotlin dayx.partx.main.kts
```

You have to have kotlin installed locally.
